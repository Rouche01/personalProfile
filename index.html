      <div id="about-me">
        <p>I’m Richard Emate and I make connections in design and web-programming to create excellent user-focused digital products. I believe that everything in life is interconnected in one or many interesting ways and that excellent works or discoveries are made when these connections are figured out. This is why I derive intense pleasure in seeking out these connections by exploring knowledge in various unrelated fields or topics because I know they all come together at the end to create a beautiful piece.</p>
        <p>I’m super interested in making a lot of stuff; I want to write, build businesses, develop web apps, create user focused designs and many other thing that piques my curiosity at different times. So, I’m sort of a generalist and because of this I’m learning to apply laser-focus on acquiring competence at my latest curiosity</p>
        <p>As a result of my generalist tendency, I love to learn new stuffs. I like to gain new perspective about life and that’s why I read a lot of non-fiction, it’s one of the best ways to learn and I also believe it is a form of intense mental exercise especially when you read difficult books</p>
        <p>When I am not working, I love to read and hangout with my friends debating about any matter we deem fit.</p>
